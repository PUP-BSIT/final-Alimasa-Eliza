          <p>
            I am 19 years old, and I grew up having a computer at home. My uncle
            used to have computer shop before and I am always there playing and
            doing things that's kind of different for a kids before, Instead of
            playing outside with toys, I am at the computer shop trying to play
            dota or troubleshoot a computer. I get happy whenever I touch a
            computer it's like a part of me that needs a lot of care in order to
            last. The picture above shows me capturing the moment where I got to
            sit on the server.

          <p>
            I am a "tambay" at comshop. Sometimes, my uncle let me watch the
            shop when there's no one playing. Until now, I am still very fond of
            computers, one of the reasons is the influence of my family.
            Especially my brother, I look up to him, he said he wanted to be a
            software developer because he's lazy. And I find it cool, that in
            his job, even though it's hard they are making it easier for them as
            well as to others. That's what inspire me the most, so I decided to
            pursue this course.

        <p>
          Five years from now, I can see myself working at an IT Field. I am
          finally at my dream job where I can sit all day and facing my
          computer. I am now serving clients that wanted to have a beautiful and
          user-friendly websites. Even though It is hard, I can finally say that
          everything was worth it. And I will always be thankful.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that being in this field is hard, but this is what makes me
          happy. I excel on the field where I have to develop a game or a
          website, but I can say that I do have the ability to be a UI/UX
          Designer. I still need a lot of experience and knowledge to make my
          mockups more beautiful and easy to use, but I know that I will be able
          to do it. And I also know that soon, I can be a frontend programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I hope when that time comes, I am qualified enough to work along
          side with my professors as well as my brother.
